# Behavioral Assertions

This document defines testable behavioral assertions for CogWorks. Each assertion follows a Given/When/Then structure and maps to specific requirements from the spec. These assertions guide the interface designer on error types, inform the planner on test coverage, and give the coder clear implementation targets.

## LLM Rate Limiting

### ASSERT-LLM-001: Rate limit headers are respected

- **Given**: An LLM API response includes rate limit headers indicating 5 remaining requests and a reset time 30 seconds in the future
- **When**: The LLM Gateway processes the response
- **Then**: The rate limit state is updated with the remaining count and reset time
- **And**: Subsequent requests are paced so that the remaining budget is not exhausted before the reset time
- **Traces to**: REQ-LLM-001

### ASSERT-LLM-002: Proactive throttling delays requests before 429

- **Given**: The LLM Gateway rate limit state shows 2 remaining requests with a reset time 60 seconds in the future

- **And**: Other queued requests are paused until the retry succeeds
- **Traces to**: REQ-LLM-001

### ASSERT-LLM-004: Parallel nodes share a single rate limit budget

- **Given**: Two pipeline nodes executing in parallel, both requesting LLM calls
- **When**: The shared rate limit state shows 1 remaining request
- **Then**: Only one node's request proceeds; the other is queued until the rate limit resets
- **And**: No race condition causes both requests to fire simultaneously
- **Traces to**: REQ-LLM-002

### ASSERT-LLM-005: Halt threshold triggers pipeline abort

- **Given**: The LLM API has been continuously rate-limited (all requests throttled or returning 429) for 30 minutes (default threshold)
- **When**: The halt-threshold timer expires
- **Then**: The pipeline is aborted with a clear error indicating prolonged rate limiting
- **And**: The abort reason is recorded in the audit trail
- **And**: The work item is updated with the abort status
- **Traces to**: REQ-LLM-003

### ASSERT-LLM-006: Rate limit events are logged with visibility

- **Given**: An LLM API response triggers a rate limit state change (remaining count drops below 20% of window capacity)
- **When**: The LLM Gateway updates its state
- **Then**: A structured log entry is emitted at warning level containing: remaining count, reset time, throttle delay applied
- **And**: The `cogworks_llm_rate_limit_remaining` metric is updated
- **Traces to**: REQ-LLM-004

## Label Configuration

### ASSERT-LABEL-001: Pipeline-internal labels are always prefixed and not configurable

- **Given**: A configuration file that attempts to override the name of `cogworks:run` or `cogworks:node:*` labels
- **When**: The configuration is loaded
- **Then**: The override is ignored (or rejected with an error)
- **And**: Pipeline-internal labels retain their `cogworks:` prefix
- **Traces to**: REQ-LABEL-002

### ASSERT-LABEL-002: Workflow-semantic labels use configured names

- **Given**: A configuration that maps the `safety` workflow label to `priority:safety-critical`
- **When**: The pipeline applies the safety label to a work item
- **Then**: The label applied is `priority:safety-critical`, not the default name
- **Traces to**: REQ-LABEL-001

### ASSERT-LABEL-003: Duplicate label names are rejected at startup

- **Given**: A configuration where two different workflow labels map to the same GitHub label name
- **When**: The configuration is loaded
- **Then**: An error is emitted identifying the duplicate
- **And**: The pipeline refuses to start
- **Traces to**: REQ-LABEL-003

## GitHub Projects Integration

### ASSERT-PROJECT-001: Status is synced to project board on node transition

- **Given**: A work item configured with a GitHub Projects V2 board, and the pipeline moves the item from node A to node B
- **When**: The node transition completes
- **Then**: The project board item's status field is updated to reflect the new node
- **Traces to**: REQ-PROJECT-001, REQ-PROJECT-003

### ASSERT-PROJECT-002: Project board failure does not block pipeline

- **Given**: The GitHub Projects V2 API is unavailable (returns HTTP 500)
- **When**: CogWorks attempts to sync a work item status to the project board
- **Then**: The failure is logged at warning level
- **And**: The pipeline continues execution without delay
- **Traces to**: REQ-PROJECT-002

### ASSERT-PROJECT-003: No project board calls when not configured

- **Given**: The `config.toml` does not contain a `[github_project]` section
- **When**: A pipeline run executes
- **Then**: No GitHub Projects V2 API calls are made
- **And**: No errors or warnings are logged about project board integration
- **Traces to**: REQ-PROJECT-001

## Milestone Inheritance

### ASSERT-MILESTONE-001: Sub-work-items inherit parent milestone

- **Given**: A parent work item assigned to milestone "v2.1"
- **When**: CogWorks creates a sub-work-item from the parent
- **Then**: The sub-work-item is automatically assigned to milestone "v2.1"
- **Traces to**: REQ-PLAN-007

### ASSERT-MILESTONE-002: No milestone on parent means no milestone on child

- **Given**: A parent work item with no milestone assigned
- **When**: CogWorks creates a sub-work-item from the parent
- **Then**: The sub-work-item has no milestone assigned
- **And**: No error or warning is logged
- **Traces to**: REQ-PLAN-007, EDGE-083

## Semantic Stalling Detection

### ASSERT-STALL-001: Repeated same-category diagnostics trigger early escalation

- **Given**: A code generation node that has retried 3 times, and all 3 retries produced diagnostics in the same error category (e.g., "type mismatch")
- **When**: The retry loop evaluates the latest diagnostics
- **Then**: The node escalates early (before exhausting the full retry budget)
- **And**: The escalation reason includes the stalling category and repetition count
- **Traces to**: REQ-CODE-006

### ASSERT-STALL-002: Different diagnostic categories do not trigger stalling

- **Given**: A code generation node that has retried 3 times, with categories "type mismatch", "missing import", and "syntax error"
- **When**: The retry loop evaluates the latest diagnostics
- **Then**: No stalling is detected
- **And**: The node continues retrying normally using its standard retry budget
- **Traces to**: REQ-CODE-006

### ASSERT-STALL-003: Stalling detection tracks categories across retries

- **Given**: A code generation node that retries with diagnostics: retry 1 = "type mismatch", retry 2 = "missing import", retry 3 = "type mismatch", retry 4 = "type mismatch", retry 5 = "type mismatch"
- **When**: The retry loop evaluates after retry 5
- **Then**: Stalling is detected because 3 consecutive retries (3, 4, 5) produced the same category
- **And**: The stalling metric `cogworks_semantic_stalling_total` is incremented
- **Traces to**: REQ-CODE-006
