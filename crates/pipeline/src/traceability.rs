//! Traceability matrix — tracks requirement coverage across pipeline stages.
//!
//! The traceability matrix provides an audit trail linking each requirement
//! from the original GitHub work item to the pipeline artifacts that address
//! it, across four progressive stages:
//!
//! 1. **Architecture** — the architecture document addresses the requirement.
//! 2. **Interface** — the interface specification addresses the requirement.
//! 3. **SubWorkItem** — a planning sub-work-item is created to implement it.
//! 4. **Code** — the generated code addresses the requirement.
//!
//! ## Requirement Extraction
//!
//! Requirements are extracted from the GitHub issue body by
//! [`extract_requirements`]. The expected format is lines containing tags of
//! the form `REQ-NNN:` followed by a description (the Intake node's LLM prompt
//! instructs the issue author to use this convention).
//!
//! ## Matrix Lifecycle
//!
//! The matrix is initialised with all requirements extracted from the work item
//! body after the Intake node runs. Each subsequent node (Architecture,
//! Interface Design, Planning, Code Generation) calls
//! [`update_traceability_matrix`] with its alignment findings to advance
//! coverage flags. The final matrix is committed to GitHub via the
//! [`crate::AuditStore`] as part of the pipeline summary.
//!
//! ## Pure Business Logic
//!
//! Both functions are pure (no I/O, no async). The `nodes` crate is responsible
//! for calling them and persisting the results.
//!
//! ## Specification
//!
//! See `docs/spec/interfaces/advanced-features.md` §Traceability Matrix for
//! the full contract and examples.
