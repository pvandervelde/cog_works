//! Observability hooks — structured `tracing` span instrumentation.
//!
//! This module provides thin wrappers around [`tracing`] spans that emit
//! structured event fields aligned with the OpenTelemetry semantic conventions
//! used to produce CogWorks pipeline metrics.
//!
//! ## Design
//!
//! CogWorks uses no custom metric sink or backend. All metrics flow from
//! `tracing` spans through the OTel layer configured at startup in `cli`
//! (`tracing-opentelemetry` + OTLP exporter). Dashboard queries target the
//! OTel attribute names emitted here.
//!
//! These functions are the **canonical** way for the `nodes` crate to record
//! pipeline-level events. Direct `tracing` macro usage is permitted for
//! fine-grained node diagnostics, but pipeline metrics (node timing, retry
//! counts, rework counts, token usage) **must** go through these helpers so
//! that OTel attribute names remain consistent across all node types.
//!
//! ## Span Ownership
//!
//! All functions accept `&tracing::Span` and record events on that span using
//! `span.record(...)`. The `nodes` crate controls span creation and lifetime;
//! this module only populates fields. Callers are expected to have entered the
//! relevant span before calling.
//!
//! ## Specification
//!
//! See `docs/spec/interfaces/advanced-features.md` §Observability Hooks for
//! the full field catalog and OTel attribute mapping.
