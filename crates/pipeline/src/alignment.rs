//! Alignment verification — checks that a node's output addresses its inputs.
//!
//! Alignment verification detects cases where LLM output has drifted from the
//! work it was asked to do: implementing the wrong function, adding files
//! outside the approved scope, or failing to produce a declared output slot.
//!
//! Two check types are supported:
//!
//! - [`AlignmentCheckType::Deterministic`] — structural checks performed
//!   purely from the data in [`DeclaredNodeInputs`] and [`crate::NodeOutput`].
//!   No LLM is involved. [`run_deterministic_alignment`] implements these.
//! - [`AlignmentCheckType::LlmSemantic`] — semantic checks delegated to a
//!   (optionally different) LLM. These are orchestrated by the `nodes` crate
//!   using [`AlignmentConfig::use_different_model`]; the function signatures
//!   and result types are defined here but the LLM call itself lives in
//!   `nodes`.
//!
//! ## Blocking vs. Non-Blocking Findings
//!
//! An [`AlignmentFinding`] with `blocking: true` causes the Alignment check
//! to fail and triggers a rework cycle (subject to the rework budget from
//! [`AlignmentConfig::rework_budget`]). Non-blocking findings are recorded in
//! the audit trail but do not block progression.
//!
//! All [`MisalignmentType::ScopeExceeded`] findings are always blocking.
//! [`MisalignmentType::Missing`] findings are blocking when the missing item
//! is a declared required output slot.
//!
//! ## Pure Business Logic
//!
//! [`run_deterministic_alignment`] is pure (no I/O, no async). Semantic
//! alignment requires an LLM call and is orchestrated by the `nodes` crate.
//!
//! ## Specification
//!
//! See `docs/spec/interfaces/advanced-features.md` §Alignment Verification for
//! the full contract, field semantics, and examples.
