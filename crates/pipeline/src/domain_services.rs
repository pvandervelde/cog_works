//! Domain service traits and supporting types.
//!
//! This module defines every trait that the pipeline business logic uses to
//! interact with external domain services (e.g. Rust, KiCad, FreeCAD domain
//! service processes reached through the Extension API), the human-authored
//! interface registry, the scenario executor, and the digital-twin provisioner.
//!
//! ## Architectural Layer
//!
//! **Trait definitions (port layer).** All traits in this module live in `pipeline`
//! so business logic can depend on them without importing infrastructure. Concrete
//! implementations live in `extension-api` and other infrastructure crates.
//!
//! ## Key Design Decisions
//!
//! - Domain services are external processes — CogWorks never contains
//!   domain-specific validation logic (see `docs/spec/constraints.md`
//!   §Module Boundaries).
//! - `DomainServiceClient::handshake` must be called before any other method;
//!   implementations assert this invariant.
//! - `InterfaceRegistryLoader` loads human-authored contracts; CogWorks never
//!   creates or modifies interface definitions autonomously.
//!
//! ## Specification
//!
//! See `docs/spec/interfaces/domain-traits.md` §Domain Service Traits for the
//! full contract.
