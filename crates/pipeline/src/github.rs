//! GitHub-facing trait definitions for the CogWorks pipeline domain.
//!
//! This module defines:
//!
//! - [`EventSource`]: abstraction over *how* a pipeline step is triggered. Two
//!   infrastructure implementations exist in the `listener` crate
//!   ([`GitHubWebhookEventSource`][listener] and [`QueueEventSource`][listener]);
//!   the CLI also synthesises a one-shot event for manual runs.
//! - [`IssueTracker`]: GitHub Issues API — reading issues, managing sub-issues,
//!   typed links, labels, comments, milestones.
//! - [`PullRequestManager`]: GitHub Pull Request API — creating PRs, fetching
//!   reviews, posting review comments.
//! - [`CodeRepository`]: read-only access to repository file contents and tree.
//! - [`ProjectBoard`]: optional, non-blocking GitHub Projects V2 synchronisation.
//!
//! Supporting data types for all five traits are also declared here.
//!
//! ## Architectural Layer
//!
//! This module expresses what the pipeline domain *needs* from GitHub in terms
//! that the domain understands. The `github` and `listener` infrastructure crates
//! implement these traits; the `pipeline` crate never sees API details.
//!
//! ## Specification
//!
//! See `docs/spec/interfaces/github-traits.md` for the full contract, error
//! conditions, and the SDK gap table.
//!
//! [listener]: ../../listener/index.html
