//! Context assembly, context pack selection, and classification result types.
//!
//! This module provides:
//!
//! - [`ClassificationResult`] / [`TaskType`] — the Intake node's classification
//!   of the work item. Drives context pack selection and safety gating throughout
//!   the rest of the pipeline run.
//! - [`ContextPriority`] / [`ContextItem`] / [`ContextPackage`] — the data
//!   structures representing assembled context for an LLM node invocation.
//! - [`ContextPackTrigger`] / [`ContextPack`] / [`MergedGuidance`] /
//!   [`LoadedContextPacks`] — the Context Pack type hierarchy.
//! - [`ContextAssemblyRequest`] — parameters for one context assembly call.
//! - [`select_context_packs`], [`merge_pack_guidance`], [`assemble_context`],
//!   [`apply_priority_truncation`], [`enforce_scenario_holdout`] — context
//!   assembly functions.
//!
//! ## Scenario Holdout Constraint
//!
//! [`enforce_scenario_holdout`] **must** be called before any context package
//! is used for code generation. Scenario files must never appear in a code
//! generation context (see `docs/spec/constraints.md` §Module Boundaries).
//! `assemble_context` calls this automatically; direct callers of
//! `apply_priority_truncation` must also call it first.
//!
//! ## Architectural Layer
//!
//! **Business logic.** No infrastructure dependencies.
//! `assemble_context` is `async` because it queries [`SummaryCache`], which is
//! an async port trait defined in `pipeline` and implemented in infrastructure.
//!
//! ## Specification
//!
//! See `docs/spec/interfaces/context.md` for the full contract, merge semantics,
//! and assembly algorithm.
