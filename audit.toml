    # RUSTSEC-2023-0071: Marvin Attack timing side-channel in `rsa` v0.9.x
    # Severity: medium (CVSS 5.9)
    # Affected path: rsa <- github-bot-sdk (our own first-party library)
    # Status: No patched `rsa` version is available as of 2026-03-02.
    #         `github-bot-sdk` uses `rsa` only for JWT/webhook signature
    #         verification, not for long-term key storage or decryption of
    #         attacker-controlled ciphertext.  The attack requires many
    #         oracle queries against a live process; our webhook handler
    #         does not expose such an oracle.
    # Remediation: Upgrade `github-bot-sdk` as soon as an upstream fix or
    #              replacement crate (e.g. rsa 0.10) is released.
    #              Track via: https://github.com/RustCrypto/RSA/issues/19
